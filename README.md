## :nerd_face: My research

### [Real-Time Feedback System For Assessing Students‚Äô Attention In Class Using rPPG And Emotion Recognition.](<https://github.com/shiayongshen/Real-time_Student_Status_Detection_System_based_on_ResNet50/>)
The parts I was responsible for included model training, database setup and web development. We fine-tuned Resnet50 to detect students‚Äô expressions in class, and we got 93.33% accuracy during evaluation. Besides, we also developed a Flask-based website for students and teachers to utilize, and a relation database to store results.

### [LLaMA LoRA In PubMedQA](<https://github.com/shiayongshen/LLaMA_LoRA_in_PubMedQA/>)
We used LoRA to fine-tune LLaMA-7B, and used PubMedQ&A as the dataset. We wanted to see if a large language model could analyze tokens it had not seen during pre-training. We get 68% accuracy during evaluation.
